# SilverStripe Creative Commons content licensing

This module adds the ability to license page content under Creative Commons licences in SilverStripe CMS.

## Requirements
 * SilverStripe ^3.1+

## Installation 

```
composer require opendatanz/silverstripe-creativecommons
```

## License
See [License](license.md)

## Documentation

 1. Include the <% include Licence %> at the bottom of your templates.
 2. Log into CMS go to "Settings > Content Licence"
 3. Select your Creative Commons Licence from the dropdown.
 4. You have set the global content licence.
 5. (option) you can override the licence on a per page basis by editing each page and selecting an alternative licence.

## TODO
 - More Creative Commons API integration
 - Licensing of images and files (including the rdfa tags)
 - A way to override the default CC text in case you need to add extra disclaimers
 - Report to show the CC licenced content, images and files
 - Make the licence selection in Settings question based from the CC API (keep the per page overrides as specific licences based on jurisdiction selected in Settings).
